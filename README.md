# EAN-Comparer

Simple program that was implemented to check whether an EAN code used for selling on Amazon is also used in the warehouse management system.

## Getting Started

For a quick start clone the repository.
Change to folder and add your csv to the data folder and change the name of the sample files in parser controller.py.
After this run the program with Python 3 in your IDE or from command line:
```bash
python3 main.py
``` 
If there are any parts with same part number with different EANs you will receive the part number and both EAN-Codes in a new csv in the output folder.

##Closer Description

This short program helped after a data crash.
There was a inconsistency in the data stored in the amazon account and the data stored in the ware house management system.
